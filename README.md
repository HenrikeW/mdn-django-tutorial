# mdn Django tutorial

I'm doing [this Django tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) on mdn to get familiar with Django. 
I decided to turn this into a git repo only when I came to part 5, so everything I did before was added in one single initial commit.
